# erturk_food_app

Hello, I am Erturk Alan and this is a Flutter project.

Used packages:

provider: for state management I used provider because it's easy and most popular state management package but I know Bloc and Getx too.

hive: for local data storing I used hive because it's fast, light and it's most common practice.

http: for api calls I used http package because, I started with this package and it's most common I think.

cached_network_image: I use cached network image generally because it caches images and it's easy.

flutter_slidable: For deleting basket lines with slide gesture, I used this package because it's better in terms of user experience.
